# Kachuful Scorer - Antigravity Development Guide

> **Project:** Kachuful Card Game Scoring Application  
> **AI Agent:** Antigravity by Google Deepmind  
> **Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for building the app using Antigravity

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application tracks scores for **Kachuful** (also called Judgement), a trick-taking card game popular in India. The app automates score calculation, manages rounds, and provides statistics.

**Key Game Mechanics:**
- 2-10 players predict exact number of tricks they'll win
- Scoring: `10 + predicted tricks` if accurate, `0` if wrong
- Dealer restriction: Last bidder can't make total bids equal total tricks
- Trump rotates: Spades → Diamonds → Clubs → Hearts → No Trump

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Prompts

**Issue:** Scoring calculation incorrect
```
Debug the scoring calculation in game-logic.ts:
- Add detailed console logs for predicted vs actual
- Verify formula: 10 + predicted (if match), else 0
- Test with edge case: 0 predicted, 0 actual → should be 10 points
- Check for off-by-one errors
```

**Issue:** Mobile UI not responsive
```
Fix mobile responsiveness:
- Use Tailwind responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Test bid buttons are min 44px touch targets
- Ensure tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- Check text sizes are readable (min 16px)
- Test on iPhone SE (375px width)
```

**Issue:** State not persisting
```
Debug localStorage persistence:
- Console log state before saving
- Check localStorage in DevTools
- Verify JSON serialization doesn't lose data
- Add error handling for QuotaExceeded
- Test state restoration on page reload
```
